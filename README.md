3. **03_data-cleaning**: Techniques for handling duplicates, `NULL`s, and inconsistencies.
4. **04_data-aggregation**: Grouping, summarizing, and calculating statistics.
5. **05_window-functions**: Advanced calculations like rankings and running totals.
6. **06_date-time-analysis**: Working with temporal data and time series.
7. **07_text-analysis**: String manipulation, parsing, and pattern matching.
8. **08_performance-tuning**: Optimize your queries for speed and efficiency.
9. **09_database-administration**: Understanding schemas, metadata, and relationships.
10. **10_advanced-analytics**: Complex patterns like cohort and funnel analysis.
11. **11_security_and_access**: Managing roles, permissions, and data security.
12. **12_etl_and_batch_processing**: `INSERT-SELECT`, `MERGE` statements, and staging data.

## 🏷️ Badge Key

Each script includes a header with compatibility notes for different SQL flavors:

- ✅ **Fully Compatible**: The script should run without any modifications.
- ⚠️ **Needs Edits**: The script may require minor syntax changes. See the `Notes` section for details.
- ⛔ **Not Supported**: The feature is not supported by this SQL flavor.

## 📖 Using These Scripts as a Reference

1. **Locate the Right Script**: Use the folder structure or the search bar to find the concept you need.
2. **Read the Header**: Each script has a detailed header explaining its purpose, parameters, and SQL flavor compatibility.
3. **Adapt the Code**: Modify table and column names to match your own database schema.
4. **Test and Execute**: Run the script in your environment and analyze the results.

## 🔧 Setup
