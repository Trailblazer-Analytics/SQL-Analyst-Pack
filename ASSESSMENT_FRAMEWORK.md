**Purpose:**
To provide a structured, business-focused assessment and certification pathway for SQL analysts using the SQL Analyst Pack. This framework supports skill validation, portfolio development, and community recognition.

## Components

### 1. Skill Assessment Quizzes

- Short quizzes for each module/level
- Mix of multiple choice, short answer, and scenario-based questions
- Automated scoring and feedback

### 2. Automated Code Evaluation

- Unit tests for SQL and Python exercises
- Data validation and performance checks
- Integration with CI for instant feedback

### 3. Certification Criteria

- Clear requirements for each certification level (e.g., Foundations, Intermediate, Advanced)
- Minimum quiz scores, exercise completion, and code review
- Digital certificate and badge upon completion

### 4. Portfolio Development

- Guidelines for building a public project portfolio
- Templates for project documentation
- Peer showcase and feedback

### 5. Peer Review & Mentorship

- Framework for peer code review and feedback
- Mentorship pairing for advanced learners
- Community recognition for reviewers/mentors

### 6. Achievement Tracking & Badges

- System for tracking progress and achievements
- Digital badges for milestones (e.g., "SQL Pro", "Data Quality Champion")

## Next Steps

- Draft sample quizzes for each module
- Define automated test structure and sample test cases
- Outline certification levels and requirements
- Develop portfolio and peer review templates
- Plan for badge and achievement system
