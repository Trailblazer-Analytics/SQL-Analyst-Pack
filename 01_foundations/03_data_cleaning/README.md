## 🚀 Getting Started

### Step 1: Prerequisites Check
Ensure you've completed the **02_data_profiling** module to understand data quality issues before attempting fixes.

### Step 2: Follow the Cleaning Process
Work through scripts in order - each step builds on the previous:

1. **Find Duplicates** - Identify and understand duplicate patterns
2. **Handle Missing Data** - Implement business-appropriate missing value strategies  
3. **Standardize Formats** - Create consistent data representations
4. **Validate Quality** - Implement ongoing quality checks

### Step 3: Apply to Real Data
Practice with the provided datasets, then apply techniques to your own data challenges.
