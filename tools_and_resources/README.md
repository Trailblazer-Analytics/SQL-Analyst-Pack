-- Convert rows to columns for reporting
SELECT 
    product_category,
    SUM(CASE WHEN quarter = 'Q1' THEN sales ELSE 0 END) as Q1_sales,
    SUM(CASE WHEN quarter = 'Q2' THEN sales ELSE 0 END) as Q2_sales,
    SUM(CASE WHEN quarter = 'Q3' THEN sales ELSE 0 END) as Q3_sales,
    SUM(CASE WHEN quarter = 'Q4' THEN sales ELSE 0 END) as Q4_sales
FROM quarterly_sales
