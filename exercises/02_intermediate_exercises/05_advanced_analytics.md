# Exercise 5: Advanced Analytics and Statistical Modeling

## Business Context

You're a lead data scientist at **InsightCorp**, a data consulting company. Your clients need sophisticated statistical analysis and predictive modeling capabilities directly in SQL for real-time decision making. You'll build advanced analytics solutions that traditionally require specialized tools like R or Python, but implemented efficiently in SQL for production environments.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this exercise, you will:

- Master statistical functions and mathematical operations in SQL
- Build predictive models using regression techniques
- Implement time series analysis and forecasting
- Create advanced cohort and survival analysis
- Design A/B testing frameworks and statistical significance testing

## Database Schema

You'll be working with these analytical tables:

```sql
-- customers table
customers (
    customer_id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
    signup_date DATE,
    first_purchase_date DATE,
    customer_segment VARCHAR(20),
    geographic_region VARCHAR(50),
    acquisition_channel VARCHAR(30),
    is_churned BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    churn_date DATE,
    lifetime_value DECIMAL(15,2)
)

-- transactions table
transactions (
    transaction_id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id BIGINT,
    transaction_date DATE,
    transaction_amount DECIMAL(15,2),
    product_category VARCHAR(50),
    payment_method VARCHAR(30),
    discount_amount DECIMAL(15,2),
    is_refund BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
)

-- experiments table (A/B testing)
experiments (
    experiment_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    experiment_name VARCHAR(100),
    start_date DATE,
    end_date DATE,
    control_group_size INTEGER,
    treatment_group_size INTEGER,
    hypothesis TEXT,
    success_metric VARCHAR(50)
)

-- experiment_participants table
experiment_participants (
    participant_id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id BIGINT,
    experiment_id INTEGER,
    group_assignment VARCHAR(10), -- 'control' or 'treatment'
    assigned_date DATE,
    conversion_event BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    conversion_date DATE,
    conversion_value DECIMAL(15,2)
)

-- web_analytics table
web_analytics (
    session_id VARCHAR(100) PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id BIGINT,
    session_start TIMESTAMP,
    session_end TIMESTAMP,
    page_views INTEGER,
    bounce_rate DECIMAL(5,4),
    conversion_flag BOOLEAN,
    traffic_source VARCHAR(50),
    device_type VARCHAR(20)
)
```

## Advanced Analytics Tasks

### Task 1: Customer Lifetime Value Prediction

**Business Question**: "Can we predict customer lifetime value based on early behavioral indicators?"

Build a regression model to predict CLV using:

- Days to first purchase
- Average transaction amount in first 30 days
- Number of transactions in first 30 days
- Acquisition channel
- Geographic region

Requirements:

- Split data into training and testing sets
- Calculate model performance metrics (RÂ², RMSE, MAE)
- Identify most important predictive features
- Generate predictions for new customers

### Task 2: Time Series Forecasting

**Business Question**: "What will our monthly revenue be for the next 6 months?"

Create forecasting models using:

- Linear regression with time trends
- Seasonal decomposition
- Moving averages with seasonality adjustment
- Exponential smoothing approximation

Requirements:

- Handle seasonal patterns and trends
- Calculate confidence intervals
- Validate predictions against holdout data
- Account for business cycles and external factors

### Task 3: Cohort Analysis and Survival Modeling

**Business Question**: "How do different customer acquisition cohorts behave over time, and what's the probability of churn?"

Implement comprehensive cohort analysis:

- Monthly cohort retention curves
- Revenue cohorts with lifetime value progression
- Survival analysis with hazard functions
- Churn probability modeling

Requirements:

- Calculate time-to-event metrics
- Build Kaplan-Meier survival curves
- Identify factors that influence retention
- Create early warning systems for churn risk

### Task 4: A/B Testing and Statistical Significance

**Business Question**: "How do we rigorously test product changes and measure their impact?"

Build a complete A/B testing framework:

- Statistical power calculations
- Sample size determination
- Significance testing (t-tests, chi-square)
- Effect size measurements
- Multiple testing corrections

Requirements:

- Handle different types of metrics (conversion rates, revenue, engagement)
- Account for selection bias and confounding variables
- Calculate confidence intervals and p-values
- Implement Bayesian A/B testing approaches
