## 🚀 Quick Start

### Basic Python-SQL Workflow

```python
import pandas as pd
import sqlalchemy as sa
import plotly.express as px

# Connect to database
engine = sa.create_engine("postgresql://localhost/analyst_pack")

# Extract data with SQL
query = """
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    order_date,
    total_amount,
    DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date) as order_month
FROM sales_transactions 
WHERE order_date >= '2024-01-01'
"""

df = pd.read_sql(query, engine)

# Transform and visualize
monthly_sales = df.groupby('order_month')['total_amount'].sum().reset_index()
fig = px.line(monthly_sales, x='order_month', y='total_amount', 
              title='Monthly Sales Trend')
fig.show()
```
