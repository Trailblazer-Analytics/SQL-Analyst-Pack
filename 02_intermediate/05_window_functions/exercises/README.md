**Expected Columns:** CustomerId, FirstName, LastName, TotalSpent, InvoiceCount, SpendingTier, FrequencyTier, OverallSegment

**Hint:** Create separate NTILE rankings, then combine with business logic

---

### Exercise 12: Sales Performance Dashboard
**Objective:** Combine multiple window functions
