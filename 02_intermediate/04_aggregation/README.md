## 🛠️ Key Techniques You'll Master

### Aggregation Functions

```sql
-- Revenue analysis example
SELECT 
    DATE_TRUNC('month', InvoiceDate) as month,
    COUNT(*) as transaction_count,
    SUM(Total) as total_revenue,
    AVG(Total) as avg_transaction_value,
    MIN(Total) as min_transaction,
    MAX(Total) as max_transaction
FROM Invoice
GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('month', InvoiceDate)
ORDER BY month;
```

### Advanced Grouping

```sql
-- Multi-dimensional sales analysis
SELECT 
    COALESCE(Country, 'ALL COUNTRIES') as country,
    COALESCE(Genre.Name, 'ALL GENRES') as genre,
    SUM(InvoiceLine.UnitPrice * InvoiceLine.Quantity) as revenue
FROM Invoice i
JOIN Customer c ON i.CustomerId = c.CustomerId
JOIN InvoiceLine il ON i.InvoiceId = il.InvoiceId
JOIN Track t ON il.TrackId = t.TrackId
JOIN Genre g ON t.GenreId = g.GenreId
GROUP BY ROLLUP(Country, Genre.Name)
ORDER BY Country, Genre.Name;
```

### Time Series Analysis

```sql
-- Year-over-year growth calculation
WITH monthly_revenue AS (
    SELECT 
        EXTRACT(YEAR FROM InvoiceDate) as year,
        EXTRACT(MONTH FROM InvoiceDate) as month,
        SUM(Total) as revenue
    FROM Invoice
    GROUP BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM InvoiceDate), EXTRACT(MONTH FROM InvoiceDate)
)
SELECT 
    year,
    month,
    revenue,
    LAG(revenue) OVER (PARTITION BY month ORDER BY year) as prev_year_revenue,
    ROUND(
        (revenue - LAG(revenue) OVER (PARTITION BY month ORDER BY year)) * 100.0 / 
        LAG(revenue) OVER (PARTITION BY month ORDER BY year), 2
    ) as yoy_growth_pct
FROM monthly_revenue
ORDER BY year, month;
```
