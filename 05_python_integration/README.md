# üêç Python-SQL Integration for Analysts

## Overview

This module demonstrates how business analysts can leverage Python alongside SQL to enhance their data analysis capabilities. Unlike data engineering approaches, these examples focus on analysis, reporting, and visualization workflows that complement traditional SQL analysis.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this module, you will:

- **Connect to databases** using Python with analyst-friendly tools
- **Execute SQL queries** from Python and work with results
- **Enhance SQL analysis** with Python's data manipulation capabilities  
- **Create visualizations** and reports combining SQL + Python
- **Automate routine analysis** tasks and reporting workflows
- **Integrate with business tools** like Excel, PowerBI, and Tableau

## Module Structure

### 01_getting_started/

#### Foundation concepts for analysts

- Setting up Python environment for data analysis
- Database connections with pandas and SQLAlchemy
- Basic SQL execution from Python
- Working with query results in DataFrames

### 02_data_analysis_workflows/

#### Common analyst workflows

- Data profiling and exploration with SQL + pandas
- Combining multiple data sources
- Data cleaning and validation workflows
- Automated data quality reporting

### 03_visualization_and_reporting/

#### Creating insights and presentations

- SQL query results to charts and graphs
- Dashboard creation with Python
- Automated report generation
- Export to Excel and PowerPoint

### 04_business_analytics_examples/

#### Real-world analyst scenarios

- Sales performance analysis and forecasting
- Customer segmentation with SQL + clustering
- A/B testing analysis workflows
- KPI monitoring and alerting

### 05_automation_and_scheduling/

#### Streamlining routine tasks

- Automated data extraction and analysis
- Scheduled reporting workflows
- Email and notification integration
- Building analyst-friendly automation

## Prerequisites

- **SQL Skills**: Intermediate SQL knowledge (modules 01-04)
- **Python Basics**: Basic Python familiarity (variables, functions, libraries)
- **Business Context**: Understanding of business analysis needs

## Required Tools

### Python Environment

```bash
# Core data analysis stack
pip install pandas sqlalchemy jupyter
pip install matplotlib seaborn plotly
pip install openpyxl xlswriter

# Database drivers (install as needed)
pip install psycopg2-binary  # PostgreSQL
pip install pymysql          # MySQL
pip install pyodbc           # SQL Server
```

### Development Environment

- **Jupyter Notebook** or **VS Code** with Python extension
- **Database access** (credentials and permissions)
- **Optional**: Anaconda for package management

## Analyst Focus

This module emphasizes:

‚úÖ **SQL-First Approach**: Python enhances, doesn't replace SQL  
‚úÖ **Business Outcomes**: Focus on actionable insights and decisions  
‚úÖ **Practical Workflows**: Real scenarios analysts encounter daily  
‚úÖ **Tool Integration**: Working with existing business applications  
‚úÖ **Automation**: Streamlining repetitive analysis tasks

‚ùå **Not Covered**: Data engineering, ETL pipeline development, infrastructure management

## Getting Started

1. **Set up environment** (see 01_getting_started/)
2. **Practice basic connections** with your database
3. **Work through examples** progressively
4. **Apply to your own** business scenarios
5. **Build automated workflows** for routine tasks

## Best Practices

### Code Organization

- Keep SQL queries in separate files when complex
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Document business logic and assumptions
- Version control your analysis scripts

### Performance Considerations

- Use SQL for heavy lifting (aggregations, joins, filtering)
- Bring only necessary data into Python
- Cache results when working iteratively
- Monitor query performance and optimize

### Collaboration

- Share reproducible notebooks with colleagues
- Document data sources and refresh schedules
- Create parameterized analyses for reuse
- Export results in business-friendly formats
