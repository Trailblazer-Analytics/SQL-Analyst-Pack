## 🤔 **What is SQL? (5-minute explanation)**

**SQL = Structured Query Language**

Think of SQL like asking questions to a database in a specific way:

### **Real Example:**
- **Question:** "How many customers do we have from each country?"
- **SQL Query:** 
```sql
SELECT country, COUNT(*) as customer_count
FROM customers 
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY customer_count DESC;
```
- **Result:** A table showing "USA: 425, Canada: 156, UK: 89..." etc.

### **Why SQL Matters for Analysts:**
- 📊 **Get data** from business databases
- 🔍 **Answer questions** like "What are our top products?"
- 📈 **Track metrics** like sales growth and customer retention
- 🎯 **Make decisions** based on actual data, not guesses

### **What You're NOT Learning:**
- ❌ Programming (this isn't Python or Java)
- ❌ Database administration (you won't manage servers)
- ❌ Software engineering (you won't build apps)

**You ARE learning:** How to ask databases for business insights!

## 🗓️ **Your 8-Week Learning Plan**

### **Week 1: Setup & First Query**
**Goal:** Get everything working and write your first query

**Tasks:**
1. ✅ **[Set up GitHub account](https://github.com/join)** (10 minutes)
2. ✅ **Fork this repository** (5 minutes) - Click "Fork" button above
3. ✅ **[Set up your environment](../README.md#-environment-setup)** (30 minutes)
4. ✅ **Write your first query** (15 minutes)

**Your First Query:**
```sql
-- This shows all customers
SELECT * FROM customers LIMIT 10;
```

**Success:** You see a table with customer data!

---

### **Week 2: Basic Queries**
**Goal:** Learn to filter and sort data

**Study:** [01_foundations/01_basic_queries](../../01_foundations/01_basic_queries/)

**Practice Goals:**
- Find customers from specific countries
- Filter orders by date ranges  
- Sort data by different columns
- Count how many records exist

**Real Business Question:** "Show me all customers from the USA, sorted by last name"

---

### **Week 3: Combining Tables (JOINs)**
**Goal:** Connect related data together

**Why This Matters:** Real business data is split across multiple tables. Customer info is separate from order info, which is separate from product info.

**Practice Goals:**
- Connect customers to their orders
- Link orders to products purchased
- Calculate totals across multiple tables

**Real Business Question:** "Which customers have spent the most money?"

---

### **Week 4: Counting & Summarizing**
**Goal:** Create business metrics and summaries

**Study:** [02_intermediate/04_aggregation](../../02_intermediate/04_aggregation/)

**Practice Goals:**
- Count customers by country
- Sum revenue by month
- Calculate average order values
- Find top-selling products

**Real Business Question:** "What are our monthly sales trends?"

---

### **Week 5: Data Quality**
**Goal:** Understand and clean messy data

**Study:** [01_foundations/02_data_profiling](../../01_foundations/02_data_profiling/) and [01_foundations/03_data_cleaning](../../01_foundations/03_data_cleaning/)

**Why This Matters:** Real data is never perfect. You'll learn to spot and handle:
- Missing information (NULL values)
- Duplicate records  
- Inconsistent formatting
- Data entry errors

**Real Business Question:** "How complete and accurate is our customer data?"

---

### **Week 6: Time Analysis**
**Goal:** Analyze trends and patterns over time

**Study:** [02_intermediate/06_date_time_analysis](../../02_intermediate/06_date_time_analysis/)

**Practice Goals:**
- Compare this month vs last month
- Find seasonal patterns
- Calculate growth rates
- Identify peak sales periods

**Real Business Question:** "How is our business growing over time?"

---

### **Week 7: Advanced Calculations**
**Goal:** Master window functions for sophisticated analysis

**Study:** [02_intermediate/05_window_functions](../../02_intermediate/05_window_functions/)

**Practice Goals:**
- Rank customers by spending
- Calculate running totals
- Compare values to previous periods
- Find top N in each category

**Real Business Question:** "Who are our top 10 customers each month?"

---

### **Week 8: Real Business Projects**

## 🆘 **When You Get Stuck**

### **"My query isn't working!"**
1. **Check for typos** - SQL is picky about spelling and punctuation
2. **Start simple** - Remove complexity until it works, then add back
3. **Read error messages** - They usually tell you what's wrong
4. **Check our [FAQ](../../FAQ.md)** - Common problems and solutions
5. **Ask for help** in [discussions](../../discussions)

### **"I don't understand the concept"**
1. **Slow down** - It's okay to repeat lessons
2. **Try examples** - Run the provided code first
3. **Change one thing** - Modify examples to see what happens
4. **Ask specific questions** - "Why does GROUP BY work this way?"
5. **Find a study buddy** - Learn together with others

### **"I'm behind schedule"**
1. **That's normal!** - Everyone learns at different speeds
2. **Focus on understanding** - Don't rush through content
3. **Skip advanced topics** - Come back to them later
4. **Celebrate small wins** - Every query that works is progress!
