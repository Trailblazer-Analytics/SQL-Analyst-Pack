-- A/B TESTING CAMPAIGN ANALYSIS  
-- Marketing Analytics Scenario for SQL Analysts
-- ============================================================================

/*
ðŸ“Š BUSINESS CONTEXT:
The marketing team ran an A/B test for two different email subject lines to 
promote a new product launch. They need to analyze the results to determine 
which version performed better and make recommendations for future campaigns.

ðŸŽ¯ STAKEHOLDER: Marketing Director
ðŸ“… TIMELINE: Test ran for 2 weeks, analysis needed within 24 hours
ðŸŽ¯ DECISION: Choose winning subject line for full campaign rollout

ðŸŽ¯ BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS:
1. Compare open rates, click-through rates, and conversion rates
2. Determine statistical significance of the results
3. Analyze performance by customer segments  
4. Calculate projected revenue impact of scaling winning version
5. Provide actionable recommendations for future A/B tests

ðŸ“ˆ SUCCESS METRICS:
- Primary: Email conversion rate (purchases / emails sent)
- Secondary: Open rate, click-through rate, revenue per email
- Segmentation: Performance by customer type, geography, device

/*
A/B Test Details:
- Test A (Control): "Don't Miss Out - New Product Launch!"
- Test B (Variant): "Exclusive Early Access - Get Yours Today"
- Sample Size: 10,000 customers per group (20,000 total)
- Test Duration: October 1-14, 2024 (2 weeks)
- Randomization: Customers randomly assigned based on customer_id

Available Tables:
- email_campaigns: Campaign details and customer assignments
- email_events: Email opens, clicks, and other interactions  
- orders: Purchase transactions during and after campaign
- customers: Customer demographics and history
