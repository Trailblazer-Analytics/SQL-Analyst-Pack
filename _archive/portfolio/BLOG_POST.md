## üé¨ The Story Behind This Project

As a data professional, I've seen countless people struggle with SQL learning resources that are either too theoretical, focus on database administration instead of analysis, or fail to bridge the gap between basic queries and real-world business applications.

**The problem?** Most SQL courses teach you syntax, but they don't teach you how to *think* like a business analyst.

That's why I created the SQL Analyst Pack ‚Äì a comprehensive learning resource that focuses on **practical business analysis skills** from day one, progresses through a carefully structured learning path, and culminates in modern analytics workflows that combine SQL with Python for today's data landscape.

## üèóÔ∏è What Makes This Different?

### 1. **Business-First Approach**
Every single example in the SQL Analyst Pack answers real business questions:
- "Which customers are at risk of churning?"
- "What are our top-performing product categories?"
- "How do we optimize our marketing campaign ROI?"

No more `SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary > 50000` ‚Äì we deal with actual business scenarios from day one.

### 2. **Progressive Learning Architecture**
The learning path is carefully designed with **5 structured phases**:

```
üìö Foundations (4 weeks)
