# üì¶ Archive Directory

This directory contains content that has been archived during the SQL Analyst Pack reorganization to maintain focus on **business analyst skills** rather than data engineering or infrastructure management.

## üìÅ Archive Structure

### `old_structure/`

#### **Empty Placeholder Directories (Archived June 22, 2025)**

- `analysis/` - Contained only placeholder README
- `examples/` - Contained only placeholder README
- `performance/` - Contained only placeholder README
- `reference/` - Contained only placeholder README
- `reporting/` - Contained only placeholder README

#### **Data Engineering-Focused Content (Archived June 22, 2025)**

- `06_data_engineering.md` - Exercise focused on ETL pipelines and infrastructure
- `05_distributed_sql_concepts.sql` - Distributed computing and cluster management
- `07_data_lake_integration.sql` - Data lake architecture and engineering
- `08_serverless_sql_processing.sql` - Infrastructure and event-driven processing

- `sql_analyst_pack_evaluation_and_reorganization.ipynb` - Evaluation notebook (outdated)

## üéØ Why These Were Archived

### Business Analyst Focus

The SQL Analyst Pack is designed specifically for **business analysts** who need to:

- Query databases for business insights
- Create reports and dashboards
- Analyze data for decision-making
- Work with existing data infrastructure

### Not Data Engineering

We archived content focused on:

- Building data infrastructure
- Managing distributed systems
- Designing ETL pipelines
- Database administration tasks
- Infrastructure provisioning

## üîÑ Restoration Process

If any archived content is needed in the future:

1. **Review the content** to ensure it aligns with business analyst focus
2. **Adapt the content** to emphasize analysis rather than engineering
3. **Move back to appropriate location** in the main project structure
4. **Update documentation** to reflect the restoration
