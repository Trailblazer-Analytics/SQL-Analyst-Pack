/*
BUSINESS OBJECTIVE:
Develop a sophisticated credit risk assessment framework that combines
traditional credit metrics, behavioral analytics, and macroeconomic factors
to predict default probability and optimize portfolio risk.

SUCCESS METRICS:
- Achieve Gini coefficient >0.7 for default prediction
- Reduce portfolio default rate by 15%
- Maintain regulatory capital adequacy ratios
- Generate early warning signals 90+ days before default

   - Basel III capital requirement calculations
   - Risk-adjusted return on capital (RAROC) optimization

2. MARKET RISK MEASUREMENT:
   - Value at Risk (VaR) using historical and parametric methods
   - Expected Shortfall (Conditional VaR) calculations
   - Comprehensive stress testing across multiple scenarios
   - Regulatory capital optimization under Basel III

3. ADVANCED RISK ANALYTICS:
   - Multi-factor risk model implementation
   - Real-time risk monitoring and alerting
   - Portfolio optimization and concentration limits
   - Regulatory compliance and reporting automation

BUSINESS IMPACT:
- Integrated risk management across credit, market, and operational risks
- Regulatory compliance with Basel III and local requirements
- Capital optimization and risk-adjusted performance measurement
- Early warning systems for proactive risk management

TECHNICAL EXCELLENCE:
- Advanced statistical modeling and backtesting frameworks
- Real-time calculation capabilities for trading environments
- Scalable architecture supporting enterprise-level portfolios
- Integration of macroeconomic factors and stress testing

This capstone demonstrates readiness for senior risk management roles in
banking, insurance, asset management, and regulatory organizations.

NEXT SECTIONS TO IMPLEMENT:
