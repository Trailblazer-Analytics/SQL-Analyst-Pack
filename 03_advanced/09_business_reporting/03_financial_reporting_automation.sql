FINANCIAL REPORTING AUTOMATION:
This script automates the monthly financial close process, providing
automated variance analysis, budget comparisons, and financial KPI tracking
that finance teams need for monthly board reports and management reviews.

TARGET USERS:
- CFO and Finance Directors
- Finance Analysts and Controllers
- Department Heads with budget responsibility
- Board members and executives

KEY FINANCIAL REPORTS:
- P&L variance analysis (Budget vs Actual)
- Cash flow summary and projections
- Department budget performance
- Financial KPI dashboard
- Automated alerts for significant variances
