-- INTRODUCTION TO RECURSIVE QUERIES
-- ==========================================
-- Recursive queries allow you to work with hierarchical and graph-structured data.
-- Common Table Expressions (CTEs) with the RECURSIVE keyword are the standard approach.

-- ==========================================
-- 1. SETTING UP EXAMPLE DATA
-- ==========================================

-- Employee hierarchy table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS employees (
    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    title VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,

    department VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    hire_date DATE NOT NULL,
    salary DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (manager_id) REFERENCES employees(employee_id)
);

-- Insert sample data
INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, name, title, manager_id, department, hire_date, salary)
